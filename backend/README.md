This is the backend for my personal site, welliver.me.

The goal is to syncronize a set of tiles representing the links on my homepage such that any visitor can arrange them like refrigerator magnet poetry, and other connected users will see their movement in real time.

I'm using the free tier of the the Azure functions serverless platform, and the Azure signalr messaging service, along with Azure cosmos DB for document storage.
